# Welcome to ZooList
I love zoos, and wherever I travel, I try to visit as many as possible. But there are tons of zoos, many of which I've never even heard of, and it's hard to remember where I've been, and when. ZooList allows users to view a list of zoos and related animal facilities, add them to their wishlist, and record their visits. Users can also use the trips feature to create itineraries, and can add multiple zoos to each trip.

<!-- [View Deployed Site](https://) -->

Main functionality:
1. View a list of zoos in the US
1. Search zoos using keywords
1. Add zoos to your wishlist
1. Create trips and add zoos to trips to create itineraries
1. Record zoo visits

Future functionality:
1. Down the road, I would like to create the functionality for users to add friends, so they can see where their friends have been and would like to go.
1. I would like to include more zoos and facilities, expanding outside of the US.

## Details
ZooList is a C# web application built with ASP.NET using Entity and Identity frameworks, and SQL Server as the database engine.
